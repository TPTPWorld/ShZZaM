% The original NL is :
Losing consciousness causes injury.
Jon was driving.
Jon fell asleep.
Show that the falling asleep did not cause an injury.
% -------------------------------------------------------------------------
% The normalized NL is :
- Losing consciousness while driving can cause an injury because the driver may lose control of the vehicle.  
- Jon was driving a vehicle.  
- Jon fell asleep while driving.  
- Demonstrate that Jon’s falling asleep did not cause an injury.
% -------------------------------------------------------------------------
% The final NL is :
For every person, vehicle, and two events, if the person loses consciousness in the first event and is driving the vehicle in the second event, then the first event causes injury if and only if the person loses control of the vehicle in the first event.  
There exists a vehicle that Jon is driving during the driving event.  
Jon falls asleep during the sleep event.  
For every person and event, if the person falls asleep during the event, then the person loses consciousness during that event.  
Does the sleep event not cause injury?
% -------------------------------------------------------------------------
% The differences between the original and final NL are:
Both segments describe nearly the same logical situation: Jon is driving, falls asleep (which implies losing consciousness), and the question is whether that event causes an injury. The second text formalizes the first in logical terms, adding explicit quantifiers and a rule linking sleep to loss of consciousness. The only minor difference is that the first text uses natural language and explicitly mentions “losing control of the vehicle,” while the second encodes that condition in a general rule. Overall, they express the same meaning with slightly different levels of formality.

% The original NL is :
Losing consciousness causes injury.
Jon was driving.
Jon fell asleep.
Show that the falling asleep did not cause an injury.
% -------------------------------------------------------------------------
% The normalized NL is :
The physiological event of an individual losing consciousness is a direct causal factor for the occurrence of a physical injury to that individual.
The individual identified as Jon was engaged in the act of operating a motor vehicle on a public thoroughfare.
While operating the motor vehicle, the individual identified as Jon involuntarily transitioned from a state of wakefulness to a state of sleep.
Provide a reasoned argument or evidence demonstrating that the involuntary transition of Jon to sleep while operating the motor vehicle did not result in any physical injury to Jon.
% -------------------------------------------------------------------------
% The final NL is :
If an event is a physiological event where an individual I loses consciousness, then there exists a physical injury to individual I that occurred, and the physiological event is a direct causal factor of that injury.
Every event is Jon operating a motor vehicle and is on a public thoroughfare.
If event EO is Jon operating a motor vehicle and event ET is an involuntary transition, then there exist events SO1 and SO2 such that ET is Jon transitioning to sleep while operating a motor vehicle EO, and ET is a transition from a wakefulness state SO1 to a sleep state SO2.
Is there no involuntary transition where Jon transitions to sleep while operating a motor vehicle, which results in a physical injury to Jon?
% -------------------------------------------------------------------------
% The differences between the original and final NL are:
Both segments describe nearly identical scenarios: Jon is driving a motor vehicle, loses consciousness (or involuntarily falls asleep), and the question concerns whether this event caused a physical injury. The main difference is stylistic and structural—the first text uses natural language and requests an argument showing no injury occurred, while the second expresses the same content in a more formal, logical, and quantified style, ending with a question about the existence of such an event. The meaning conveyed is essentially the same, with only minor differences in phrasing and logical framing.
