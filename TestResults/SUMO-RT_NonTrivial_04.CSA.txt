Both segments describe the same scenario: losing consciousness causes injury, Jon was driving, Jon fell asleep, and the question is whether Jon’s falling asleep caused an injury. The second segment restates the first in a more formal, logical framework with explicit references to events and entities, but the underlying meaning and question are essentially identical. The only difference is the level of abstraction and formalization.
