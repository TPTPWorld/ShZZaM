% The original NL is :
Exporting is a result of investing.
The United States exported oranges to France.
The importing of oranges by foreign countries led to food shortages at home.
What caused the exporting?
% -------------------------------------------------------------------------
% The normalized NL is :
1. Exporting occurs as a consequence of investment in production and trade capacity.  
2. The United States exported oranges to France as part of its international agricultural trade.  
3. When foreign countries imported large quantities of oranges, domestic food shortages occurred within the exporting nation.  
4. What factor caused the exporting activity to take place?
% -------------------------------------------------------------------------
% The final NL is :
Investment caused exporting.  
Production capacity and trade capacity caused exporting.  
The United States exported oranges to France in event e1, event e1 was part of event e2, and event e2 was an international trade.  
For every country, product, and events e1 and e2, if the country imported the product in event e1 and the product was of large quantity, then the exporting nation of that country experienced a domestic shortage in event e2.  
Is there a factor that caused exporting?
% -------------------------------------------------------------------------
% The differences between the original and final NL are:
Both segments describe the same relationships: exporting results from investment in production and trade capacity; the U.S. exported oranges to France as part of international trade; large foreign imports caused domestic shortages; and a question is asked about the cause of exporting.  
The second segment expresses these ideas in a more formal, logical style using event variables and quantifiers, while the first uses natural language sentences. The meaning is nearly identical, differing mainly in representation rather than content.
