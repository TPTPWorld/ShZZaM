% The differences between the original and final NL are:
The two segments are nearly identical in meaning.

None of these alter the underlying meaning or relationships described.

% The differences between the original and final NL are:
Both segments describe the same scenario: Terry has a traditional savings account with a financial institution that includes transaction limits and fees, Terry makes a withdrawal, and the institution imposes a fee, followed by a question about whether the withdrawal caused the fee.  
The main difference is in representation: the first is written in natural language, while the second expresses the same information in a formal, ontology-like structure defining entities and relations.
