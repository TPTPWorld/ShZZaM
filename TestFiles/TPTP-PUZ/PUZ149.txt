Assume that a chemical compound C is made by pouring the elements A and B into the same beaker. 
The two elements A and B are not acid. 
It is possible that after making the compound C it results in an acid. 
Is it possible that pouring element A results not in an acid, and pouring A and B in the beaker 
results in an acid?
