Splot, Split, and Splat move diagonally in the plain, and are the only things that move in such a way
A thing that bamboozles always shmutzes its target, and is never smaller than its target
Splat shmutzes nothing that Splot shmutzes
Splot shmutzes everything except Split
Split shmutzes everything not smaller than Splot
Split shmutzes everything Splot shmutzes
Nothing shmutzes everything
Splot is not Split, Split is not Splat, Splat is not Splot
Who bamboozled Splot?
