Several fortunate visitors have an opportunity to attend the Midseason Art Fair, in which they 
are able to observe a variety of Knowheyans art forms. 
An artists' competition was held as part of the fair and awards were given for the top four 
entries, which were a collage painting, a holography, a laser etching, and a reconstituted 
materials sculpture. 
The interpreter is explaining the results of the competition to the visitors:
1. A, who was not the first-place winner, did not enter a holograph.
2. The fourth-place winner did not enter a sculpture or a holograph.
3. The one who entered the collage painting, who was neither A nor C, did not win first or second 
place.
4. Neither B, nor the one who entered the laser etching, was the fourth-place winner.
5. The third-place winner was neither B nor C.
6. The one who entered the laser etching, who was not A, was not the second place winner.
What was the art entry of each of the four?
