The only animals in this house are cats.
Every animal that loves to gaze at the moon is suitable for a pet.
When I detest an animal, I avoid it.
No animals are carnivorous, unless they prowl at night.
No cat fails to kill mice.
No animals ever take to me, except what are in this house.
Kangaroos are not suitable for pets.
None but carnivora kill mice.
I detest animals that do not take to me.
Animals that prowl at night always love to gaze at the moon.
Do I always avoid a kangaroo?
