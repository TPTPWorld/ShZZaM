Wolves, foxes, birds, caterpillars, and snails are animals, and there are some of each of them. 
Also there are some grains, and grains are plants. 
Every animal either likes to eat all plants or all animals much smaller than itself that like to 
eat some plants. 
Caterpillars and snails are much smaller than birds, which are much smaller than foxes, which in 
turn are much smaller than wolves. 
Wolves do not like to eat foxes or grains, while birds like to eat caterpillars but not snails.
Caterpillars and snails like to eat some plants. 
Is there is an animal that likes to eat a grain eating animal?
