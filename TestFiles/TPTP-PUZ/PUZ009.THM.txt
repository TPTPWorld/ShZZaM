On the idland there are knights who always tell the truth, and knaves who always lie.
In another curious incident, when the husband arrived on an island looking for Oona, he met 5 
natives A,B,C,D,E who all guessed his purpose and grinned at meeting him. They said:
A: Oona is on this island. 
B: Oona is not on this island.
C: Oona was here yesterday. 
D: Oona is not here today, and she was not here yesterday. 
E: Either D is a knave or C is a knight.
The logician thought for a while, but could get nowhere. 
At this point A said: Either E is a knave or C is a knight. 
Is Oona on the island?
