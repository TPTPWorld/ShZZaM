All the dated letters in this room are written on blue paper.
None of them are in black ink except those that are written in the third person.
I have not filed any of them that I can read.
None of them that are written on one sheet are undated.
All of them that are not crossed are in black ink. 
All of them written by Brown begin with "Dear Sir"
